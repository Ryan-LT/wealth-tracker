-- Add a login account. Replace the values, then run it in the Neon SQL Editor.
-- The new account starts with no data; the person fills it in after signing in,
-- and can change the password themselves in Settings.
-- Usernames and emails are case-insensitive (stored lowercase); the password is stored as a bcrypt hash.
